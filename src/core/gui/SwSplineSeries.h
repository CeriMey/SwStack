 * @brief Declares the spline-based series type used for smoothed charts.
 *
 * `SwSplineSeries` models the same logical point set as a line series, but it carries the
 * intent that the renderer should interpolate those points with smooth curves. This makes
 * it suitable for dashboards that want less angular visual output than straight segments.
